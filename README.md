# tws-web-misc

Bunch of misc stuff and gigant repo that I test projects in. Why use multiple repo if I can use only one?

# Stability warning(WIP)
These libs aren't stable so far, so you probably do not want to use them just yet.
There is ongoing work to port them from my private monorepo and make them usable for public.

Bunch of misc js stuff, like galleries, players, gatsby plugins and so on.
License for each subproject is available at respective folder. Most likely project you're looking for is on MIT
license.

## Why so many project in single git repo?

Because from my experience managing single repo is simpler than managing multiple repos.
Code here is for the most part process of porting my already-written-and-lying-somewhere-stuff to publicly usable libs.
