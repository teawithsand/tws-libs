# tws-trans

Translation framework like i18n, but much simpler to use.

## Core concept - strictly typed translations
It turns out that it's actually amazing. You just define interface for whatever you want to be translated
and then use it with react. To large extent, this is what this library does aside from doing stuff like managing
current language via contexts.
