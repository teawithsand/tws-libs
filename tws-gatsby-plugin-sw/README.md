# tws-gatsby-plugin-sw

Like `tws-gatsby-plugin-sw` but is easier to configure and is configurable in a way that `gatsby-plugin-offline` isn't.

This project heavily reuses `gatsby-plugin-offline` code, thus is MIT licensed with original Gatsby's copyright.
See [gatsby-plugin-offline's page](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-offline/).

# TODO
- Customizable app shell
