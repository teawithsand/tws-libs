# pk2-web

Port of [Pekka Kana 2](https://github.com/danilolc/pk2) to web browser with SVG rendering engine.
It's kind of PoC for modern browser SVG + transform performance.

# Work not in progress anymore
Reimplementing it from scratch with something like PhaserJS would have been easier and faster and I probably will do that one day, but for now I've got other stuff to work on. Therefore I pause development of this project.

Main reason is that source code is in finnish and it's quite difficult to read IMHO. Part of it is due to me not being C programmer. Aside from that, when I've looked at source code for AI in finnish, I gave up.

If you're interested in this project try mailing me at teawithsand@gmail.com.
